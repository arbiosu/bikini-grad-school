We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:

## 4. Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service.

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encryption of data in transit (TLS/SSL), secure server infrastructure, and access controls limiting employee access to personal data.

Payment information is handled exclusively by Stripe, which is certified to PCI-DSS Level 1 — the most stringent level of certification in the payments industry.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
